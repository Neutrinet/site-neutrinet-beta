!!!! A [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) is a tool widely used in the business world. It relies on the [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) of all network exchanges _(traffic)_ between two entities _(people, buildings, geographically remote places,…)_ with the different [Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) being **unable to watch or interact with what is happening** _(except for blocking everything, but we are not there yet, or copying everything with the idea of deciphering it later)_.
